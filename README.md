#### The goals of this project are:

- To make a **100% rust** web server
- To focus on **speed**, **performance** and **compatibility**
- To have as **little dependencies** as *~~humanly~~* possible.
- To implement cool features that make writing websites a lot more fun!
    - My idea is to be able to add special syntax to you're html that will do certain things, such as:
        - Importing headers and footers WITHOUT SILLY JAVASCRIPT OR PHP, it will just be injected on request :D!
        - And other things that I will think of later, maybe create an issue with some ideas!

#### What am I currently working on?

- Implementing HTTP 1.0

#### TODO:

- Support for TLS
- Support for newer HTTP
- Security checks for requested file paths
- Config files
- ***And probably more!***
