# Polar Bear

### This is very experimental software, and it *~~might~~* will not function correctly!

#### The goals of this project are:

- To make a **100% rust** web server
- To focus on **speed** and **performance**
- To have as little dependencies as ~~humanly~~ possible.

#### What am I currently working on?

- Implementation of TLS 1.3

#### TODO:

- Proper HTTP implementation
- Security checks for requested file paths
- Config files
- Proper HTTPS support
- ***And probably more!***
